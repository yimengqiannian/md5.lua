# md5.lua
An md5 library for lua(need bit library). Translated from [blueimp/JavaScript-MD5](https://github.com/blueimp/JavaScript-MD5/blob/master/js/md5.js "blueimp/JavaScript-MD5")

And find a way to upload this library to NodeMCU by ESPlorer with in 255 characters one line and 4k memory.
then compile these three files to .lc files and remove these lua files,load the labrary by require"md5m" at last.
good luck!
